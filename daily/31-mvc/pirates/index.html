    Pirates are known to trade doubloons for parrots. This app is
    going to make that extremely for them.

    Click the 'buy parrot' button, increase parrots by one and
    decrease doubloons by 5.

    Click the 'sell parrot' button, increase doubloons by 5 and
    decrease parrots by one.

    Q1: what is stored in our model?
        - doubloons (number)
        - parrots (number)

    Q2: what goes in our view?
        - two buttons (buy and sell)
        - display amount of each
    
    We're going to be using AmpersandJS to demo this. Angular solves
    pretty much the same problem. Both of these are frameworks.

    Unofficial definitions
    A LIBRARY is a collection of code designed to help you do a 
    particular thing easily or well. For example, formatting dates
    and times or showing things on a map. They typically only
    affect part of your application.

    A FRAMEWORK is a collection of code designed to help you build an
    application. You must decide a framework at the beginning of 
    development because changing frameworks is not easy.
