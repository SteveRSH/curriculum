/**
 * CHALLENGE
 * 
 * Create an Angular app that lists an array of books. You should have a button for each
 * book that changes the 'checked_out' status from true to false.
 * 
 * If the book is checked out, the button should say 'Return'.
 * If the book isn't checked out, the button should say 'Check out'.
 * 
 * Books should have a 'title' (string), 'author' (string), and 'checked_out' (boolean) property.
