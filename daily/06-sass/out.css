/*
  A CSS file is automatically a valid Sass file. You can 
  copy and paste your CSS over if you want to (though
  sometimes its easier / cleaner to rewrite).

/*
    WHY YOU SHOULD LIKE SASS

    1. Nesting: putting rules inside of other rules
        - Lets us mirror the structure of HTML and keep everything 
          related to styling a particular section in one place.
    2. Partials: breaking stylesheets into multiple files
        - Instead of one long file, have many short files.
        - Example: header.scss, main.scss, footer.scss, layout.scss
    3. Variables: assign names to values vs writing them over and over again
        - Common measurements (font size, colors, margins, media queries) can use 
          variables instead of repeating the same measurements.
    4. Watch: automatically generate CSS from Sass
        - You can forget there's even a difference; all the wins with none of 
          the losses.
