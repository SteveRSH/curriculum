/**
 * ES6 is the latest version of Javascript. It's short for 
 * ECMAScript version 6, which is the standard that defines the
 * Javascript language.
 * 
 * ES6 was finalized last year and is supported by all major 
 * browsers. It introduces dozens of new features; today we'll
 * go over my favorite six.
 * 
 * Most of these are SYNTACTIC differences, meaning new ways to
 * write the same old stuff. We'll discuss differences as they
 * come up.
 * 
 * 1. Arrow functions
