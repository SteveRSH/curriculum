## Congrats on a job well done!

I hope you're proud of how much you've accomplished over the past three months. We've had a chance to cover a lot of important ideas together but even more important than the class time is what you do after it. Take a well-deserved break but don't forget that this is the takeoff, not the landing, and there are a lot of great technologies, groups, projects, and other resources that can help you develop your skills.

The goal of this guide is to provide some topics and resources for self-study that I'd recommend based on what you've learned so far. The first section is for stuff you *really should do* to keep your core strong, and the second is a buffet-style bucket of things that will help you broaden your knowledge beyond the core.

Stay in touch!

### SHOULD do

- **PRACTICE Javascript**. Write code at least a few days a week, but ideally every day. It doesn't matter what you do. Do old homeworks. Work on a project by yourself. Do practice problems and then throw them away. Try contributing to an open-source project. Collaborate with another student on a side project. Use it or you'll lose it, and you've worked too hard for that. 
  - [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a great site for practice problems like we've been doign in class and lets you see how other users solve them as well.

- Get more practice with **responsive layouts**. Foundation is popular these days, but [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) are pretty popular as well. If you can't get paid for it, practice reimplementing pages on [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/) or building your own website.

- Listen to other people talking about development. For frontend in particular I'd recommend the [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) podcast, the [You Don't Know JS book series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), [A List Apart blog](http://alistapart.com/), the [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) mailing list, and the bible of responsive web design, mysteriously named [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design). I would try your best to [attend meetups](http://www.meetup.com/), and stay active within the Iron Yard community (including meeting alumni who have been working for a bit).

- Pick up a side project; I'd recommend starting with a personal portfolio site. Think through the design and content, throw it up on Surge or Github pages, and consider ordering a custom domain (`yourname.com`). Even once you're working it's a good idea to keep a side project alive because it'll allow you to continue to learn outside of the constraints of your work.

### MIGHT do

- Consider trying out a different **application framework** - you've got plenty to choose from. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (or React Native for mobile apps) is the hotness now, and React's design pushes you to write modular code (a Good Thing). [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) is new but looks flippin' awesome, and introduces other great patterns like type safety (see Typescript below) and [reactive patterns](http://blog.angular-university.io/functional-reactive-programming-for-angular-2-developers-rxjs-and-observables/). [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) is delightfully simple and my current fav. [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is heavily functional and leads to some of the highest code quality in the land. [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) is also new and supposedly very good.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) is one of the best recent developments in the Javascript ecosystem IMO. It allows you to write Javascript with *explicit type annotations* (you state what type each variable should have, and gulp or an alternative tool tells you when you break the rules). I personally find that I write much clearer and easier-to-debug code with Typescript than vanilla JS.

- Try backend development; I'd recommend writing a full stack app (frontend + backend) yourself using NodeJS on the backend. Start of with creating a server with a library like [hapi](https://hapijs.com/), and eventually give databases a shot. MySQL is a very common database, and there's an [npm module](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#introduction) for connecting and querying MySQL databases. Learning about databases is likely going to be one of the larger backend topics that you haven't had any exposure to; here's a good [Khan Academy intro](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) to SQL, the most common database query language.

- Try another language! I'd recommend [Python](https://www.python.org/) (it has many similarities to Javascript and is common for writing servers or doing data science) but Java and .NET are also really popular among employers in Charlotte.

- Functional programming practice. Functional programming is all the rage and you will blow minds during interviews if you're comfortable with it (not to mention getting all the benefits of functional code). Practicing with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` will be great practice, and if you feel comfortable with those then I'd recommend checking out [lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) for next level functional kung-fu.

- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is similar to Gulp but popular in the React community. It's got some really interesting differences and is worth being familiar with (even if you're not a pro).

### Technologies I love

- VueJS
- Vuex / Redux: 'state containers', very useful for component-based apps (i.e. React or Vue apps)
- Typescript
- Immutable JS
